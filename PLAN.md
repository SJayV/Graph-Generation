# PLAN

This project processes one feature at a time (plan -> test -> implement ->
document -> finalize). Structural correction (confirmed by the user): this is
**one feature**, "Visual Tuning", made of **three user stories**:

1. Centralized Parametrization
2. Run Control Keybindings
3. Noise-Driven Edge Shading

Per `AGENTS.md`, planning is only complete once all three stories below are
finalized with converged, testable acceptance criteria. All three are
finalized below — no open questions remain for any of them.

`parameters.js` is the root-level single source of truth for tunables. Only
the root files (`graph.js`, `dispatcher.js`, `main.js`, `panel.js`) read or
write it; lower layers (`logic/`, `algorithms/`, `rendering/`, `empirical/`)
receive the values as arguments.

# Feature: Visual Tuning

## Ideas

- **Domain concept**: three independent-but-related capabilities make up one
  coherent "tune how the demo looks and behaves at runtime" feature: (1) a
  single configuration source of truth, (2) keyboard-driven run control built
  on that source of truth, and (3) a new fixed visual style for vertices and
  edges. (1) is a prerequisite for (2)'s editable panel; (3) is independent of
  both but shares the feature's "tuning" theme and its root-level/rendering
  touch points.
- Full rationale for each story's internal design choices is kept inline
  under that story's own section below, to keep each story self-contained.

## Requirements

Requirements are grouped per story below (Group 1 / Group 2 / Group 3),
since each story has a distinct concern even though they share one feature.
